*Note- 
    1.Mocakroo for random data generator(useing json).....
    2.For Desktop users the we render the json file on call of '/users/'
        which print a HTML Document file in browser. apart from that for 
        mobile user we can set the url as '/api/users/' for hybrid server.
        it's a good pratice for the both browser and mobile users.
        (if it's 'api/users/' url then throw a json data otherwise it throw 
        a HTML file on calling the  url '/users')
    3. in POST, PATCH, DELETE have some problem within it.
        the browser by default do the GET req.
    4. With GET, PATCH, DELETE have the same route(path) -> '/api/users/:id'
        with the grouping we can perform 
                        -> getting single 
                        -> Edit 
                        -> Delete
         task at a time.
    5. send POST req through the postman and created a middleware in index.js.
